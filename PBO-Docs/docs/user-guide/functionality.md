The application boasts a range of features aimed at providing users with a comprehensive and user-friendly task
management experience.

### Searching

A search bar located at the top of the screen facilitates the search for specific terms within all todo-entries. So that
even in the Focus Mode you will be able to find other entries, that aren't normally displayed.
Clearing the search can be achieved by clicking the 'x'-button. This will reset the current view back to normal. In case
of the Focus Mode the top 5 most crucial tasks will be displayed again.

### Sorting

The app enables users to apply a single sorting criterion at a time. Sorting functionality is available to arrange
entries based on title, deadline, expenditure, or the timestamp of addition. Additionally, sorting can be configured in
ascending or descending order.

completed, while a right swipe deletes it.

### Adding and Editing Entries

A todo-entry encompasses various attributes, with the title being the mandatory field. Other attributes, such as
deadline, estimated duration, tags, and a description, are optional and can be added as needed. The color of an entry
can also be customized. To do this, you can use the dialog that appears when clicking on the color box located to the
right of the input field for tags, and then select the desired color. Users have the flexibility to edit all attributes
by selecting the entry and clicking on the pencil icon. This way it is easily possible to correct any attributes without
deleting the entry and creating a new one.
