## Overview Mode

The Overview Mode is currently under construction and will probaly not be finished in time for the deadline.
The main idea is to show all tasks in a three column grid format, where scrolling is possible.

## Tags

Tags are also not implemented yet, but will be used to filter or sort tasks by their tags, so a use can add a tag "work" to all tasks that are related to work and then filter for all tasks with the tag "work". Each tag will have a color assigned, so the user can easily distinguish between different tags/entries.
